## Data formats

- [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)

> ISO 8601 Data elements and interchange formats – Information interchange – Representation of dates and times is an international standard covering the exchange of date- and time-related data.

- [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754)

> The IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic (IEEE 754) is a technical standard for floating-point arithmetic established in 1985 by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).

- [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode)

> Unicode is an information technology standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing systems.

## Algorithms and Protocols

- [The Open Graph protocol](https://ogp.me/)

> The Open Graph protocol enables any web page to become a rich object in a social graph. For instance, this is used on Facebook to allow any web page to have the same functionality as any other object on Facebook.


- [Data compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression)

> In signal processing, data compression, source coding, or bit-rate reduction is the process of encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation.
>
> Any particular compression is either lossy or lossless. Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information.[3] Typically, a device that performs data compression is referred to as an encoder, and one that performs the reversal of the process (decompression) as a decoder.

- [Coding theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_theory)

> Coding theory is the study of the properties of codes and their respective fitness for specific applications. Codes are used for data compression, cryptography, error detection and correction, data transmission and data storage. Codes are studied by various scientific disciplines—such as information theory, electrical engineering, mathematics, linguistics, and computer science—for the purpose of designing efficient and reliable data transmission methods. This typically involves the removal of redundancy and the correction or detection of errors in the transmitted data.

> There are four types of coding: <br/>
> 1. Data compression (or source coding)<br/>
> 2. Error control (or channel coding)<br/>
> 3. Cryptographic coding<br/>
> 4. Line coding

- [The Lempel–Ziv (LZ) compression methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77_and_LZ78)

> LZ77 and LZ78 are the two lossless data compression algorithms published in papers by Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv in 1977 and 1978.
>
> They are both theoretically dictionary coders.

- [LZ4 (compression algorithm)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ4_(compression_algorithm))

> LZ4 is a lossless data compression algorithm that is focused on compression and decompression speed.
>
> It belongs to the LZ77 family of byte-oriented compression schemes.
